# LITA_EC2_INSTANCE_PROJECT_TEJIRI_AGANBI 
 A project that showcases the building of a Scalable Web Infrastructure for SmartShop and provisioning of EC2 instance in the AWS environment
## Installing GitHub for Documentation and Presentation
I installed and set up the GitHub for Desktop on my windows 11.
This is to help me document the process of building a scalable web application infrastructure for client SmartShop.
This document would serve these few of many important purposes:
### 1. Clear Guidance for Everyone: 
This documentation will serve as a roadmap, to help everyone understand how the web application infrastructure is built which will make it easier to maintain consistency when updates or changes are needed.
### 2. Faster Problem-Solving:
When something malfunctions, this documentation will show where things went wrong, so issues can be fixed quickly without unnecessary guesswork.
### 3. Smooth Teamwork and Handoffs: 
With everything clearly written down in this document, new team members or partners of SmartShop can jump in without feeling lost, which makes collaboration and transitions much easier.
### 4. Proof of Compliance and Security:
This documentation will serve as a record that shows everything was done by the book according to SmartShop's need and requirements, which is crucial for passing security checks, audits, and meeting legal requirements.
### 5. Room to Grow: 
As SmartShop grows, this documentation will make it easier to upgrade or scale the system since there’s a clear guide showing what’s already in place and how to build on it.

With the above listed, I proceeded to create a new repository with a README.md, initialized and named : "LITA_EC2_INSTANCE_PROJECT_TEJIRI_AGANBI" in my system's GitHub from which I push changes made with notepad++ to the origin on the net. I then clicked on published now.
